## One liner

Write a very short sentence (< 10 words) that describes what your app is about (e.g. "Airbnb for boats", or "Movies recommendation engine").

**Answer:**

LaTeX combined with an intuitive user interface.

## Project description

Provide a short description of what the app does (< 1000 characters).

**Answer:**

This application allows one to use a set of modified basic LaTeX commands to inject nice looking mathematical symbols and figures into an otherwise ordinary word processor. The goal is to make the power of LaTeX more accessible to educators and students (particularly at the high school level).

## MVP

Choose the core feature that most defines your app and you’ll start to tackle first (e.g. "Users should be able to take a picture of a food item with their smartphone and receive a list of recipes based on that ingredient").

**Answer:**

Easy and intuitive implementation of symbols that are hard to type into a document/pdf.

## Tech stack

Does your app have a client, a server, or both? If it has a client, is it web or mobile? What frameworks, databases, or relevant libraries are you going to use? Fill the fields here below as needed.

**Front End:**

I like Angular so I was going to try using it for the solo project.

**Back End:**

I don't think I need a server.

## Data sources

In case your app relies on some data to work properly, where are you planning to get that data from?

**Answer:**

Overleaf/CLSI API's should provide the LaTeX tools I need.
