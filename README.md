# Visual LaTeX

Visual LaTeX is a simple WYSIWYG Markdown editor that goes through a LaTeX compiler to generate professional looking articles and presentations. In addition, you can see in real time the output of your markdown editor directly side by side in the browser. 

The inspiration for this project comes from LyX, but on a smaller scale as LyX can be intimiating to jump into immediately. The audience for this project would be students at the high school level and high school teachers who want to create a professional template for their assignments and notes.
